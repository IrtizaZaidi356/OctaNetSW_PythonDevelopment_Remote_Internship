## **Task 01 | ATM INTERFACE** 

## **Perform Task No# 01**

- The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them. It is a console-based application with five different classes. In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts. Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. 
- **As a result of the project, the following operations can be performed:**
  1) Transactions History
  2) Withdraw
  3) Deposit
  4) Transfer
  5) Quit

## **Project No#01: Python ATM System**

### **Introduction:**
  - The Python ATM System is a console-based application designed to provide users with basic banking functionalities. Written in Python, the system requires users to input their user ID and PIN to access services, ensuring security and privacy.

### **User Authentication:**
  - Upon initiation, users are prompted to enter their user ID and PIN. The system verifies this information before granting access to the ATM functionalities, ensuring a secure login process.

### **Menu and Operations:**
  - The system offers a user-friendly menu with five operations: Transactions History, Withdrawal, Deposit, Transfer, and Quit. Each operation is implemented as a method within the ATM class, providing a structured and organized approach to user interactions.

### **Transaction History:**
  - Users can view their transaction history, which is stored within the system. This feature enhances transparency and allows users to track their financial activities easily.

### **Withdrawal, Deposit, and Transfer:**
  - The system supports basic banking operations, allowing users to withdraw funds, make deposits, and transfer money to other accounts. Input validation ensures that only valid transactions are processed.

### **Error Handling:**
  - The system incorporates error-handling mechanisms to manage invalid PINs, insufficient balances, and other potential issues, ensuring a robust and reliable user experience.

### **Conclusion:**
  - The Python ATM System provides a functional and secure environment for users to perform essential banking operations. This project serves as a foundation for further enhancements, such as integrating a user database for a more realistic implementation.

In **Summary**, the Python ATM System project showcases the implementation of core banking functionalities in a console-based application, highlighting the flexibility and simplicity of Python for such applications.
